# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Final Project

## Theme
I thought about the theme very abstractly, building off it using a lot of assets I had my eye on recently. I decided to create a game that seems very straightforward and one-dimensional, i.e. another 2d platformer; and then for there to be a button, and have it change the entire game to a top-down or 3d setting, to completely disarm the player. Almost a redpill of sorts.
