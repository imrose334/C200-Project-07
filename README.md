# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Final Project

## Theme
I thought about the theme very abstractly, building off it using a lot of assets I had my eye on recently. I decided to create a game that seems very straightforward and one-dimensional, i.e. another 2d platformer; and then for there to be a button, and have it change the entire game to something entirely different. Like, a 3d setting, or a different camera view, to completely disarm the player. 

## Game Play
The objective of the first level is to find the hidden button zone, where the button will magically appear. The game is won when you make your way to the end of the second level to return home to your dimension.
Game-play instructions
LEVEL 1:  movement: wasd, attack: space
LEVEL 2:  ......

## What did you ....
Struggles or surprises you encountered during the development of the game
I struggled with the time constraints, as I have been busy recently, and I apologize for my failure to submit this assignment on time. 


## Implementation

## Special Focus

My special focus is the music I provided, which I composed and produced myself, as well as the game setting and structure / coding. 
I also decided to include some of my own art this time, in the form of pixel art on the second level. 
I also decided to implement some custom mechanics I thought would be interesting, such as interaction with the environment. 
I would rate my own effort a 4 or 5/5.
